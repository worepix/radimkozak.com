I am student of heavy-current specialization on Secondary School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and Higher Technical School in Liberec. However I'm trying to get skill in weak-current more than in my specialization. Electrical Engineering isn't the only direction I'm trying to get skill in. It is also coding from cloud over mobile apps up to microcontrollers. Recently I became part of [BigClown](https://www.bigclown.com/) team where we are making user-friendly Internet of Things kit. Checkout my blog posts and follow me on my social networks. Teď by mělo?
